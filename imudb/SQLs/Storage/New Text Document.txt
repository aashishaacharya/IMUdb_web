Supabase Storage (like AWS S3) doesn't really have traditional folders. Instead, organization is achieved using prefixes in the object's path (its name). When you upload a file with a / in its name, the UI and libraries interpret it as a folder structure.

Recommended Structure: Use the unique ID of each site (site_id or location_id from your database table) as a "folder" name within your main bucket.

Create a bucket named site_images (make it Private).
When uploading an image for a site with site_id = 'abc-123', upload it with a path like: abc-123/site_photo_front.jpg
Another image for the same site: abc-123/equipment_closeup.png
Image for a different site (site_id = 'def-456'): def-456/overview_shot.jpg
